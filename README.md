# Amazon Project

This is a clone of amazon.com to learn and practice JavaScript

## Note

This project was made while following along SuperSimpleDev's JavaScript course on YouTube (https://youtu.be/EerdGm-ehJQ?si=qRLuoJgb3qvx_WuS).
The code is identical to the course in some parts, but the majority is my own.
